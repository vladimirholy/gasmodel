## Introduction

We loosely follow Tomanová and Holý (2021) and analyze the timing of orders from a Czech antiquarian bookshop. Besides seasonality and diurnal patterns, one would expect the times of orders to be independent of each other. However, this is not the case and we use a GAS model to capture dependence between the times of orders.

A strand of financial econometrics is devoted to analyzing the timing of transactions by the so-called autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) model introduced by Engle and Russell (1998). For a textbook treatment of such financial point processes, see e.g. Hautsch (2012).

```{r setup, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gasmodel)
```

## Data Preparation

Let us prepare the analyzed data. We use data `bookshop_sales` containing times of orders from June 8, 2018 to December 20, 2018. We calculate differences of subsequent times, i.e. durations. To avoid zero durations, we set them to 0.5 second.

``` {r data}
data(bookshop_sales)
data_dur <- bookshop_sales %>%
  mutate(duration = as.numeric(time - lag(time)) / 60) %>%
  mutate(duration = recode(duration, "0" = 0.5)) %>%
  mutate(just_time = as.vector(as.POSIXct(format(time, "1970-01-01 %H:%M:%S"), tz = "UTC"))) %>%
  drop_na()
```

There is a strong diurnal pattern present, as we can see from the following figure:

``` {r diurnal}
model_spline <- smooth.spline(data_dur$just_time, data_dur$duration, df = 10)

ggplot(mapping = aes(x = model_spline$x, y = model_spline$y)) +
  labs(title = "Diurnal Pattern of Durations", x = "Time", y = "Duration") +
  geom_line(color = "#2E67C5") +
  scale_x_time(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 24 * 60 * 60, by = 6 * 60 * 60)) +
  theme_bw()
```

We adjust the observed durations for this diurnal pattern and extract the time series to be analyzed:

``` {r variables}
data_dur <- data_dur %>%
  mutate(duration_spline = predict(model_spline, x = just_time)$y) %>%
  mutate(duration_adj = duration / duration_spline) %>%
  select(-just_time)

y <- data_dur$duration_adj
```

## Model Estimation

``` {r distr}
distr(filter_type = "duration", filter_dim = "uni", filter_default = TRUE)[, 1:3]
```

First, we estimate the model based on the exponential distribution:

``` {r exp}
est_exp <- gas(y = y, distr = "exp")
est_exp
```

Second, we estimate the model based on the Weibull distribution:

``` {r weibull}
est_weibull <- gas(y = y, distr = "weibull", par_static = c(FALSE, TRUE))
est_weibull
```

Third, we estimate the model based on the gamma distribution:

``` {r gamma}
est_gamma <- gas(y = y, distr = "gamma", par_static = c(FALSE, TRUE))
est_gamma
```

Fourth, we estimate the model based on the generalized gamma distribution:

``` {r gengamma}
est_gengamma <- gas(y = y, distr = "gengamma", par_static = c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))
est_gengamma
```

By comparing the Akaike information criterion (AIC), we find that the most general model, i.e. the one based on the generalized gamma distribution, is the most suitable.

``` {r aic}
AIC(est_exp, est_weibull, est_gamma, est_gengamma)
```
